# VergilAPI
Vergil API is a multi-purpose .NET API for utility and quality of life improvements for .NET projects.

This API is written in C# and supports any .NET-compatible platform. Some features include:

* string extensions, such as `CountOf(string target)` that counts the number of occurances of `target` in a string, or `Capitalize()`, which capitalizes the first letters of each word.

* Enum extensions, such as `EnumName()` which gets the name of an enum member.

* Configuration, logging, problem catching, and program timing for easy creation of programs that run in the background on a set schedule or timer.

* Easy FTP and HTTP wrappers.

* XML interface with a hierarchical tree.

* Easy wrapper for connecting to MS Access databases.

* Easy sending of email messages (provided you have access to an SMTP server).
