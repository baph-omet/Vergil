Oh shoot.
Shucks.
Da'gum.
D'oh.
Aww, tartar sauce.
Ouch.
Well that's not right.
Ya dun goof'd.
It won't let me.
Houston, we have a problem.
A thing happened.
Oye, tenemos una problema.
Not again!
You've gotta be kidding me.
What'd you do that for?
I trusted you!
Nope.avi
Well, at least I tried.
Danger, Will Robinson.
I hate it when that happens.
OHHHHH NOOOOOOO!
Where's the N-1?
Hey, who turned out the lights?
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
Doctor, we're losing him!
*Sigh* I'll go get the shovel.
Son, I am dissapoint.
Curse your sudden, but inevitable betrayal.
You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say \Don Corleone, give me justice.\ But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.
Did you try restarting it?
Don't try this at home.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.
It's not working and I'd like it to stop doing that.
They say it's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. Well, squeak squeak.
This is just between you and me. And everyone else who got this email.
We need to go deeper.
Did someone forget the Seven P's?
Blame Canada!
'Murica.
What kind of Mickey Mouse operation is this?
Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this. I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.
Where's my Megawatt?
Don't blink. Blink, and you're dead.
My leg!
So it's treason, then.
I tried, and therefore no one can judge me.
This must be the work of an enemy「S T A N D」!
That's not what you want.
Big mood.
Yeet.
This is not the bug you are looking for.
Help! Can anyone hear me? I'm trapped inside some sort of error log!
Sometimes a bug is just a bug.
Did you try Git Gud?
Oof.
Willie hears ya. Willie don't care.
Lands sakes alive!
Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good...
Unauthorized off-world activation!
Indeed.
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!
Michael!
Hope don't make megawatts!
